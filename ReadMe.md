# VigenÃ¨re Cipher

Polyalphabetic substitution is an improvement over the simpler Caesar cipher. Each letter is shifted based on the
relative position of letters in a corresponding keyword.

## Getting Started

```bash
brew install go

```bash
go install github.com/simonmittag/vigenerecipher/cmd/vigenere
```

This will make the `vigenere` command available globally.

## Usage

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·vigenere 0.0.1
Usage: vigenere [options]
Options:
  -d    Decrypt the input file and store results in output file
  -e    Encrypt the input file and store results in output file
  -h    Print usage information
  -i string
        Path to the input text file (required)
  -o string
        Path to the output text file (required)
  -p string
        A password for both encryption or decrytion
```

### Examples

#### Encrypt a File
